# Two-Dimensional (2D) Arrays  

**Two-Dimensional (2D) Arrays**  

A **two-dimensional (2D) array** is an array of arrays. It represents a grid or a table of elements, often visualized as rows and columns. To access an element, you typically need two indices: one for the row and one for the column.  

**Analogy:** A chessboard or a spreadsheet, where you specify both the row and column to find a cell.  

**Example:**  
If we have a 2D array `matrix`  
```
matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
```
* `matrix[0][0] is 1 (first row & first column)`
* `matrix[0][1] is 2 (first row & second column)`
* `matrix[0][2] is 3 (first row & third column)`
* `and so on ...`
