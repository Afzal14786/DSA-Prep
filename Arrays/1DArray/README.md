# 1D Arrays  

**One-Dimensional (1D) Arrays**  
A one-dimensional (1D) array is the simplest form of an array. It represents a linear list of elements. You need only one index to pinpoint an element.  

**Analogy:** A single row of lockers, where each locker has a unique number.

**Example:**  
If you have an array arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]:  
* `arr[0] is 10`
* `arr[1] is 20`
* `arr[2] is 30`
* `arr[3] ...`
* `arr[4] is 50`
