# Binary Search Tree (BST)  

In binary search tree, for every node all the elements in it's left sub-tree are smaller than that node and all the elements in the right sub-tree are greated than that node.  

**Properties of BST**  
-   _BST will not have duplicates values or keys_
-   _If we perform inorder traversal in BST, then the result will always in sorted order._
-   _If we have `n` nodes then there are 2nCn / n+1 BST can be generated_  

_Bianry trees are useful for searching. Because the binary tree, usually takes $O(logn)$ time, for searching_
