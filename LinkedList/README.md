# Linked List  

A **linked list** is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.

1. It is a **linear dynamic data structure**  
2. The number of **nodes** in a linked list is not fixed, means that it can grow and shrink on demand.  
3. Each linked list is made-up of two items:  
    -  **The Data**
    - **A referance to the next node**
4. The last node has a referance to `null`.
5. The entry point of a linked list is called `head` of the list. (If the list is empty then the head is a null referance)  

## Why Linked List  
_Both `linked list` and `arrays` are used to store data or the collection of data, since both are used for same purpose_  

- _**We should know in which cases `array` are suitable and in which cases `linked list` is suitable.**_  

## Linked List v/s Arrays  

**Arrays**  
_Arrays is also a liner data structure and used to store data or collection of data / information but in the memory arrays store the data in contiguous, **means that each data or element is uniquely identified by an index or key, typically start from `0`**_.  

_Arrays store elements of the same data type, such as **integers**, **characters**, or **objects**._  

_**Arrays has it's own advantages or disadvantages:**_  

_Advantages:_
- __a. Simple and easy to use__
- __b. Faster access to the element (constant access)__  
    * Elements are accessed using an index, which represents their position within the array. This allows for constant-time access to any element, regardless of the array's size.


_Disadvantages:_  
-   **a. Fixed Size:**  
    *   _This is the major disadvantage of arrays, it can not grow and shrink on demand. Once memory is created, it's size cannot be changed_.
-  **b. Memory Wastage:**
    *   _If we declare an array with large size and let say the entire array is not used then the unused memory is wasted_.
-   **c. Overflow:**
    *   _If we need to store more elements than the array's declared capacity, we can't simply add more space. We have to create a new, larger array and copy all the elements from the old one to the new one, which is an inefficient process_.
-   **Inefficient Insertion and Deletion üê¢**  
    *   _Insertion and deletion in an arrays is very difficult in a given position compare to linked list or any other data structure_  

**Linked List**  
_**Linked List also comes with it's own advantages and disadvantages:**_  

_Advantages:_  

- In linked list it can be **expanded** in constant time.  
- We can start with space for just one allocated element and _add_ new element easily without the need to do any copying and reallocating.  

_Disadvantages:_  
There are list of issues with linked list. The main disadvantage of linked lists is that:  

- The _**access time**_ to individual element . Linked list takes `O(n)` time for access to an element in the list in the wrost case.
- Linked list also waste memory in terms of extra referance pointers.


## Type Of Linked List  
-   1. Singly Linked List ‚û°Ô∏è
-   2. Doubly Linked List ‚ÜîÔ∏è  
-   3. Circular Linked List üîÑ  

**Singly Linked List**  

_A **singly linked list** is the most basic type. Each node contains two parts: **the data** and a **single pointer** (or link) that references the **next node** in the sequence. Traversal is `unidirectional`, meaning we can only move forward through the list, from `head` to `tail`. The last node's pointer is typically set to `null`, indicating the end of the list._  
-    **Structure:** [Data | Next]

**Doubly Linked List**  
_In a **doubly linked list**, each node has **two pointers**. One pointer links to the **next node** in the sequence, and the **other links** to the `previous node`. This structure allows for `bidirectional traversal`, meaning you can **navigate both forward and backward through the list**. While this provides more flexibility than a singly linked list, it requires more memory to store the additional pointer in each node._  

-   **Structure:** [Previous | Data | Next]  

**Circular Linked List**  
_A **circular linked list** is a variation in which the **last node** of the list points back to the **first node**, instead of pointing to null. This creates a `continuous loop`. A circular linked list can be either `singly or doubly linked`._  

-   **Singly Circular Linked List:** The last node's **next** pointer points to the head of the list.  
-   **Doubly Circular Linked List:** The last node's **next** pointer points to the head, and the head's "previous" pointer points to the last node, creating a complete circle in both directions.
